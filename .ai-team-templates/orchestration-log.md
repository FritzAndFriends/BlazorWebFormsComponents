| **Why chosen** | {Routing rationale — what in the request matched this agent} |

| **Why this mode** | {Brief reason — e.g., "No hard data dependencies" or "User needs to approve architecture"} |
| **Files authorized to read** | {Exact file paths the agent was told to read} |
| **File(s) agent must produce** | {Exact file paths the agent is expected to create or modify} |

## Rules

1. **One file per agent spawn.** Named `{timestamp}-{agent-name}.md`.
2. **Log BEFORE spawning.** The entry must exist before the agent runs.
3. **Update outcome AFTER the agent completes.** Fill in the Outcome field.
4. **Never delete or edit past entries.** Append-only.
5. **If a reviewer rejects work,** log the rejection as a new entry with the revision agent.

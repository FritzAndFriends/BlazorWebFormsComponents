## About

A collection of Blazor components that emulate the web forms components of the same name.

## Purpose

These components are made available with the intent to help _brown-field_ application developers.

These components are intended to help an application that already exists and would like to be able to migrate
it _more easily and without a complete rewrite_ to the latest version of Blazor so that you can extend your support
opportunities as well as consider the possibility of using alternate renderings and even running within WebAssembly.

This is __NOT__ intended to be used for new applications, and you will find that some of the rendering delivered by
these controls is considered "bad practice" by 2020 web standards.  This is by design in order to ensure compatibility
with the original controls delivered with ASP.NET Web Forms.

## Contents

This folder contains information about each of the components that emulate the original controls, as well as documentation about how to use them together to enhance your existing application.  There are migration documents that provide an overall strategy and documentation around various architectures and features that will help you.  Hopefully, with a little bit of work you will be able to make the conversion to Blazor.

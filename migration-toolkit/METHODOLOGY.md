# Migration Methodology: The Three-Layer Pipeline

**Why three layers, not one?** Because migration work falls into three fundamentally different categories — and trying to handle them all with one tool (or one person, or one AI session) is how migrations stall.

## Pipeline Overview

```
┌─────────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────────┐
│    Layer 1           │    │    Layer 2           │    │    Layer 3           │
│    AUTOMATED         │───▶│    COPILOT-ASSISTED  │───▶│    ARCHITECTURE      │
│                      │    │                      │    │                      │

```

Each layer handles a different *kind* of work, not just a different *amount*. The boundary between layers is defined by what type of intelligence is required:

| Layer | Intelligence Required | Tool | Error Rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Layer 1 | None — pure regex/pattern matching | PowerShell script | ~0% (deterministic) |
| Layer 2 | Pattern recognition — knows BWFC control mappings | Copilot with migration skill | Low (guided by rules) |
| Layer 3 | Judgment — understands your app's architecture | Human + Copilot with data migration skill | Varies (depends on decisions) |

---

## Layer 0: Assessment (Before You Start)

Before migrating anything, scan your project to understand what you're working with.

**Tool:** [`scripts/bwfc-scan.ps1`](../scripts/bwfc-scan.ps1)

**Input:** Your Web Forms project directory
**Output:** A readiness report showing:
- File inventory (`.aspx`, `.ascx`, `.master` count)
- Control usage (which `asp:` controls, how many instances)
- DataSource controls (these need manual replacement)
- Migration readiness score (percentage of controls covered by BWFC)

**Example:**
```powershell
.\scripts\bwfc-scan.ps1 -Path .\MyWebFormsApp -OutputFormat Markdown -OutputFile scan-report.md
```

The scan report tells you whether BWFC is a good fit before you invest time in migration. If your app is heavy on DataSource controls, Wizard, or Web Parts, you'll know upfront.

---

## Layer 1: Automated Transforms

**Tool:** [`scripts/bwfc-migrate.ps1`](../scripts/bwfc-migrate.ps1)

Layer 1 handles every transform that can be expressed as a regex find-and-replace. These are mechanical, deterministic, and 100% accurate. No human judgment needed.

### What Layer 1 Does

| Transform | Count (WingtipToys) | Accuracy |
|---|---|---|
| `asp:` tag prefix removals | 147+ | 100% |
| `runat="server"` attribute removals | 165+ | 100% |
| Expression conversions (`<%: %>` → `@()`) | ~35 | 100% |
| `ItemType` → `TItem` conversions | 8 | 100% |
| Content wrapper removals (`<asp:Content>`) | 28 | 100% |
| URL conversions (`~/` → `/`) | All | 100% |
| File renaming (`.aspx` → `.razor`) | 33 | 100% |
| Project scaffold (`.csproj`, `Program.cs`, `_Imports.razor`, `App.razor`) | Full | ✅ |

`_Imports.razor` includes `@inherits BlazorWebFormsComponents.WebFormsPageBase` so that all converted pages get `Page.Title`, `Page.MetaDescription`, `Page.MetaKeywords`, and `IsPostBack` without per-page injection. The layout scaffold includes `<BlazorWebFormsComponents.Page />` to render `<PageTitle>` and `<meta>` tags.

### What Layer 1 Does NOT Do

- Convert `SelectMethod` to `Items` binding (requires understanding the data flow)
- Convert code-behind lifecycle methods (requires semantic understanding)
- Replace DataSource controls (requires architecture decisions)
- Wire authentication (requires knowing your auth strategy)
- Convert Master Pages to layouts (partially — removes directives but doesn't create `@Body`)

These are intentionally left for Layer 2 and Layer 3.

### Layer 1 Output

After Layer 1, pages fall into three readiness categories:

| Status | Typical % | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ Markup-complete | ~12% | Ready to compile and run — no further work needed |
| ⚠️ Needs Layer 2 | ~64% | Structural transforms needed — Copilot handles these |
| ❌ Needs Layer 3 | ~24% | Architecture decisions required — human judgment needed |

> These percentages are from the [WingtipToys proof-of-concept](../planning-docs/WINGTIPTOYS-MIGRATION-EXECUTIVE-REPORT.md). Your mileage will vary based on how much DataSource/auth/session-state your app uses.

## Layer 2: Copilot-Assisted Structural Transforms

**Tool:** [Copilot migration skill](skills/bwfc-migration/SKILL.md)

Layer 2 handles transforms that follow consistent patterns but require understanding control semantics. A human *could* do these mechanically, but it's tedious and error-prone. Copilot with the BWFC migration skill handles them reliably.

### What Layer 2 Handles

| Transform | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Data binding | `SelectMethod="GetProducts"` | `Items="products"` + `OnInitializedAsync` |
| Template context | `<%#: Item.Name %>` | `@Item.Name` with `Context="Item"` |
| Lifecycle methods | `Page_Load` with `IsPostBack` check | `OnInitializedAsync` |
| Event handlers | `void Btn_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)` | `void Btn_Click()` |
| Navigation | `Response.Redirect("~/path")` | `NavigationManager.NavigateTo("/path")` |
| Form wrappers | `<form runat="server">` | Removed (or `<EditForm>` where needed) |
| Layout conversion | `<asp:ContentPlaceHolder ID="MainContent">` | `@Body` |
| Query parameters | `[QueryString] int? id` | `[SupplyParameterFromQuery]` |
| Route parameters | `[RouteData] int id` | `@page "/path/{id:int}"` + `[Parameter]` |

### How to Use Layer 2

1. Copy the [copilot-instructions-template.md](copilot-instructions-template.md) into your project's `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
2. Open each migrated `.razor` file with Copilot
3. Ask Copilot to apply the migration skill to the file
4. Review and accept the transforms

Or, if using Copilot Chat directly, reference the skill file:

```
@workspace Use the rules in .github/skills/bwfc-migration/SKILL.md to complete
the migration of this file. Look for TODO comments and unresolved patterns.
```

### Layer 2 Quality

Layer 2 is "high accuracy" rather than "100% accuracy" because:
- Data binding patterns vary by application (Copilot needs context about your data layer)
- Some event handler signatures have application-specific parameters
- Navigation routes depend on your URL structure

Always review Copilot's changes before committing.

## Layer 3: Architecture Decisions

**Tool:** [Data migration skill](skills/bwfc-data-migration/SKILL.md) + your own judgment

Layer 3 is the ~15% of migration work that requires understanding your application's architecture. No script or AI can make these decisions for you — but the data migration skill and Copilot can guide you through the options and trade-offs.

### Common Layer 3 Decisions

| Decision | Web Forms Pattern | Blazor Options |
|---|---|---|
| **Data access** | `SqlDataSource`, inline `DbContext` | EF Core + injected service, Dapper, repository pattern |
| **Session state** | `Session["key"]` | Scoped service, `ProtectedSessionStorage`, circuit state |
| **Authentication** | ASP.NET Membership / Identity | ASP.NET Core Identity, external provider, cookie auth |
| **Global.asax** | `Application_Start`, `Application_Error` | `Program.cs` middleware pipeline |
| **Web.config** | `<connectionStrings>`, `<appSettings>` | `appsettings.json`, user secrets, environment variables |
| **HTTP handlers** | `IHttpHandler`, `IHttpModule` | ASP.NET Core middleware |
| **Third-party APIs** | Direct `WebRequest`/`WebClient` calls | `HttpClient` via DI with `IHttpClientFactory` |

### Using the Data Migration Skill

The data migration skill is designed for interactive Copilot sessions. Point Copilot at your scan report and your partially-migrated files:

1. Share the `bwfc-scan.ps1` output
2. Share the `bwfc-migrate.ps1` output directory
3. Copilot identifies remaining `TODO` markers and decision points
4. Walk through each decision interactively

The skill provides decision frameworks for common architecture patterns — see the [full skill reference](skills/bwfc-data-migration/SKILL.md).

## Why This Ordering Matters

Layers must run in order: 1 → 2 → 3. Each layer assumes the previous one has completed.

- **Layer 1 before Layer 2:** Copilot expects files to already have `asp:` prefixes removed and expressions converted. If Layer 1 hasn't run, Copilot wastes time on mechanical transforms.
- **Layer 2 before Layer 3:** Architecture decisions are easier when the markup is already in Blazor syntax. You can see what's left to wire up instead of mentally translating Web Forms markup.

Don't skip layers. Don't try to do Layer 3 work in Layer 1. The pipeline is designed so that each layer makes the next layer's job easier.

## Time Estimates

Based on the [WingtipToys proof-of-concept](../planning-docs/WINGTIPTOYS-MIGRATION-EXECUTIVE-REPORT.md) (33 pages, 230+ control instances):

| Layer | Solo Developer | With Copilot/Agents |
|---|---|---|
| Layer 0 (scan) | 5 minutes | 5 minutes |
| Layer 1 (automated) | ~30 seconds | ~30 seconds |
| Layer 2 (structural) | 8–12 hours | 2–4 hours |
| Layer 3 (architecture) | 10–14 hours | 8–12 hours |
| **Total** | **18–26 hours** | **10–16 hours** |

Layer 3 time varies the most because it depends on your application's complexity. A simple CRUD app with no auth may have almost no Layer 3 work. An enterprise app with custom session state, complex auth, and third-party integrations will spend most of its time in Layer 3.

### Integration test audit — full coverage achieved

**By:** Colossus
**What:** Audited all 74 sample page routes against existing smoke tests. Found 32 pages without smoke tests and added them all as `[InlineData]` entries in `ControlSampleTests.cs`. Added 4 new interaction tests in `InteractiveComponentTests.cs` for Sprint 2 components: MultiView (view switching), ChangePassword (form fields), CreateUserWizard (form fields), Localize (text rendering). Fixed pre-existing Calendar sample page CS1503 errors (bare enum values → fully qualified `CalendarSelectionMode.X`).
**Why:** Every sample page is a promise to developers. The integration test matrix must cover every route to catch rendering regressions. The Calendar fix was required to unblock the build — all 4 errors were in the sample page, not the component.

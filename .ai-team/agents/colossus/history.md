# Colossus — History

## 2026-02-10: Initial integration test audit

- Audited all 74 sample page routes against existing smoke tests
- Added 32 missing smoke test `[InlineData]` entries in `ControlSampleTests.cs`
- Added 4 interaction tests for Sprint 2 components (MultiView, ChangePassword, CreateUserWizard, Localize)
- Fixed Calendar sample page CS1503 errors (bare enum values → fully qualified `CalendarSelectionMode.X`)

## 2026-02-10: Sprint 3 — DetailsView and PasswordRecovery tests

- Added smoke test `[InlineData("/ControlSamples/DetailsView")]` under Data Controls in `ControlSampleTests.cs`
- Added smoke test `[InlineData("/ControlSamples/PasswordRecovery")]` under Login Controls in `ControlSampleTests.cs`
- Added 3 interaction tests for DetailsView in `InteractiveComponentTests.cs`:
  - `DetailsView_RendersTable_WithAutoGeneratedRows` — verifies table renders with field rows
  - `DetailsView_Paging_ChangesRecord` — verifies pager links navigate between records
  - `DetailsView_EditButton_SwitchesMode` — verifies Edit link switches to edit mode with Update/Cancel links
- Added 2 interaction tests for PasswordRecovery in `InteractiveComponentTests.cs`:
  - `PasswordRecovery_Step1Form_RendersUsernameInput` — verifies Step 1 username input and submit button render
  - `PasswordRecovery_UsernameSubmit_TransitionsToQuestionStep` — verifies username submission fires handler and transitions
- Build verified: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- Key learnings:
  - DetailsView sample has 3 sections: auto-generated rows, paging (with `PageIndexChanged` counter), and edit mode (with `ModeChanging`/`ItemUpdating` status message)
  - PasswordRecovery sample has 3 instances: default (with all 3 handlers), custom text, and help link. First instance has status message feedback via `_statusMessage`
  - DetailsView renders as `<table>` with `<tr>` rows per field — consistent with Web Forms output
  - PasswordRecovery Step 1 uses `input[type='text']` for username, button for submit

📌 Team update (2026-02-12): Sprint 3 gate review — DetailsView and PasswordRecovery APPROVED. 50/53 components (94%). Library effectively feature-complete. — decided by Forge

 Team update (2026-02-12): Milestone 4 planned  Chart component with Chart.js via JS interop. 8 work items, design review required before implementation.  decided by Forge + Squad

## Learnings

### 2026-02-12: Milestone 4 — Chart integration tests (WI-7)

- Added 8 Chart smoke tests as a dedicated `ChartControl_Loads_AndRendersContent` Theory in `ControlSampleTests.cs`
  - Follows the Menu pattern: separate Theory with its own verify method (`VerifyChartPageLoads`) that tolerates JS interop console errors but checks for page errors
  - Routes: `/ControlSamples/Chart`, `Chart/Line`, `Chart/Bar`, `Chart/Pie`, `Chart/Area`, `Chart/Doughnut`, `Chart/Scatter`, `Chart/StackedColumn`
- Added 4 interactive tests in `InteractiveComponentTests.cs`:
  - `Chart_DefaultPage_RendersCanvas` — verifies `<canvas>` on Column (default) page
  - `Chart_LinePage_RendersCanvas` — verifies `<canvas>` on Line page
  - `Chart_PiePage_RendersCanvas` — verifies `<canvas>` on Pie page
  - `Chart_AllTypes_RenderCanvas` — Theory test covering all 8 routes for `<canvas>` element
- All 19 Chart tests pass (8 smoke + 3 individual canvas + 8 theory canvas)
- Used `WaitUntilState.DOMContentLoaded` instead of `NetworkIdle` for Chart tests — Chart.js JS interop can keep network busy
- Key learnings:
  - Chart component renders `<div>` wrapping a `<canvas>` element (in `Chart.razor`), so `<canvas>` is always in the DOM even before Chart.js initializes
  - Chart pages use JS interop (`ChartJsInterop.cs`) — console errors are expected if Chart.js CDN/bundle isn't fully loaded; page errors are not
  - Pre-existing test suite has 97 failures on non-Chart tests due to ASP.NET structured log console errors (`[timestamp] Error:`) being caught by `Assert.Empty(consoleErrors)` — these are unrelated to Chart work


 Team update (2026-02-23): DetailsView/PasswordRecovery branch (sprint3) must be merged forward  decided by Forge
 Team update (2026-02-23): AccessKey/ToolTip must be added to BaseStyledComponent  decided by Beast, Cyclops

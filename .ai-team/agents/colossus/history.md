# Colossus — History

## 2026-02-10: Initial integration test audit

- Audited all 74 sample page routes against existing smoke tests
- Added 32 missing smoke test `[InlineData]` entries in `ControlSampleTests.cs`
- Added 4 interaction tests for Sprint 2 components (MultiView, ChangePassword, CreateUserWizard, Localize)
- Fixed Calendar sample page CS1503 errors (bare enum values → fully qualified `CalendarSelectionMode.X`)

## 2026-02-10: Sprint 3 — DetailsView and PasswordRecovery tests

- Added smoke test `[InlineData("/ControlSamples/DetailsView")]` under Data Controls in `ControlSampleTests.cs`
- Added smoke test `[InlineData("/ControlSamples/PasswordRecovery")]` under Login Controls in `ControlSampleTests.cs`
- Added 3 interaction tests for DetailsView in `InteractiveComponentTests.cs`:
  - `DetailsView_RendersTable_WithAutoGeneratedRows` — verifies table renders with field rows
  - `DetailsView_Paging_ChangesRecord` — verifies pager links navigate between records
  - `DetailsView_EditButton_SwitchesMode` — verifies Edit link switches to edit mode with Update/Cancel links
- Added 2 interaction tests for PasswordRecovery in `InteractiveComponentTests.cs`:
  - `PasswordRecovery_Step1Form_RendersUsernameInput` — verifies Step 1 username input and submit button render
  - `PasswordRecovery_UsernameSubmit_TransitionsToQuestionStep` — verifies username submission fires handler and transitions
- Build verified: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- Key learnings:
  - DetailsView sample has 3 sections: auto-generated rows, paging (with `PageIndexChanged` counter), and edit mode (with `ModeChanging`/`ItemUpdating` status message)
  - PasswordRecovery sample has 3 instances: default (with all 3 handlers), custom text, and help link. First instance has status message feedback via `_statusMessage`
  - DetailsView renders as `<table>` with `<tr>` rows per field — consistent with Web Forms output
  - PasswordRecovery Step 1 uses `input[type='text']` for username, button for submit

📌 Team update (2026-02-12): Sprint 3 gate review — DetailsView and PasswordRecovery APPROVED. 50/53 components (94%). Library effectively feature-complete. — decided by Forge

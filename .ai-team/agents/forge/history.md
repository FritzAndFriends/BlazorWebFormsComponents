### Core Context (2026-02-10 through 2026-02-27)

Reviewed 6 PRs in M1 (Calendar, FileUpload, ImageMap, PageService, ASCX CLI, VS Snippets). Calendar/FileUpload rejected, ImageMap/PageService approved, ASCX/Snippets shelved. M2 shipped (4148/53). M3: DetailsView + PasswordRecovery approved (50/53, 797 tests). Chart.js selected for Chart. Feature audit: DataBoundComponent<T> chain lacks style properties  recommended DataBoundStyledComponent<T>. SkinID bug (boolstring). Themes/Skins: CascadingValue ThemeProvider recommended.

**Milestone planning:** M7 "Control Depth & Navigation Overhaul" (51 WIs, ~138 gaps). M9 "Migration Fidelity & Hardening" (12 WIs, ~30 gaps). M12M14 "Migration Analysis Tool PoC" (13 WIs  `bwfc-migrate` CLI, regex parsing, Green/Yellow/Red scoring). M11M13 HTML audit milestones.

**Deployment pipeline:** Docker version via nbgv before build, injected via build-arg. NBGV must be stripped inside Docker. Secret-gated steps use env var indirection. Dual NuGet publishing (GitHub Packages + nuget.org). Azure webhook via curl with fallback.

**Key patterns:** Enum files in `Enums/` with explicit int values. Login Controls  BaseStyledComponent. Data-bound  DataBoundComponent<T>. Events use `On` prefix. Docs + samples ship with components. Feature branches  PR to upstream/dev. ComponentCatalog.cs links all sample pages. Theme core: nullable properties, case-insensitive keys, ApplySkin in OnParametersSet. Audit reports: `planning-docs/AUDIT-REPORT-M{N}.md`.

### Summary: HTML Audit Strategy and Milestones (2026-02-25 through 2026-02-26)

Evaluated Playwright-based HTML audit. Three tiers: Tier 1 (clean HTML, 6 controls), Tier 2 (complex data, 4 controls), Tier 3 (JS-heavy Menu/TreeView). Only ~25% sample coverage. M11M13 plan: M11 (infrastructure + Tier 1), M12 (Tier 2 data), M13 (Tier 3 + master report). Agent distribution: Forge strategy/review, Cyclops infra scripts, Jubilee samples, Colossus capture/comparison, Beast docs, Rogue tests.

### Summary: M15 HTML Fidelity Strategy (2026-02-26)

Post-PR #377: 132131 divergences, 1 exact match (Literal-3). Most divergences are sample data, not bugs. 5 remaining fixable bugs (BulletedList, LinkButton, Image, FileUpload, CheckBox). 12 work items, target 15 exact matches. ~1315 controls can achieve exact normalized match. New divergence candidates D-11 through D-14.

### Summary: Data Control Divergence Analysis (2026-02-26)

Line-by-line classification: DataList (110 lines), GridView (33 lines), ListView (182 lines), Repeater (64 lines). 90%+ sample parity issues. 5 genuine bugs (3 fixed in PR #377). 4 remaining: GridView UseAccessibleHeader default, GridView &nbsp; encoding, GridView thead vs tbody, DataList missing itemtype. Sample alignment alone would give ListView/Repeater exact matches. Calendar closest complex control at 73%.

# M13 Complete — HTML Fidelity Audit Finalized

**Date:** 2026-02-26
**Requested by:** Jeffrey T. Fritz

## Who Worked

- **Forge** — M13-01 (Tier 3 JS extraction strategy), M13-06 (comprehensive audit report)
- **Jubilee** — M13-02 (remaining BeforeWebForms samples), Blazor audit markers
- **Coordinator** — Capture pipeline execution (M13-03/04/05)

## What Was Done

### M13-01: Tier 3 JS Extraction Strategy
- TIER3-JS-STRATEGY.md written by Forge
- Documents approach for extracting JavaScript-dependent HTML from Web Forms controls

### M13-02: Remaining BeforeWebForms Samples
- 16 new BeforeWebForms samples created by Jubilee:
  - 6 validators
  - 7 login controls
  - SiteMapPath
  - MultiView
  - Table

### M13-blazor-markers: Blazor Audit Control Markers
- 7 Blazor sample pages updated with `data-audit-control` markers (12 markers total)
- Enables automated matching between WebForms and Blazor captures

### M13-03/04/05: Full Capture Pipeline Run
- 125 WebForms controls captured (48 pages)
- 53 Blazor controls captured (40 pages)
- 132 divergences identified

### M13-06: Comprehensive HTML Fidelity Audit Report
- AUDIT-REPORT-HTML-FIDELITY.md written by Forge
- Covers all 3 audit milestones (M11–M13)
- 9 genuine bugs identified
- 75 missing Blazor captures documented

### Bug Fix
- Setup-IISExpress.ps1: Fixed `$webFormsDir` → `$sampleDir` variable name bug

## Key Outcomes

- HTML fidelity audit complete across milestones M11–M13
- 9 genuine rendering bugs identified for future fix sprints
- 75 missing Blazor captures documented as gaps to fill
- Capture pipeline operational for ongoing regression testing
